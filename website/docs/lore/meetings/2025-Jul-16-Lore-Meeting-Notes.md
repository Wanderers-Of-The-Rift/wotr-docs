## Ability Guilds
- Three ability guilds are fully written and published on Wotr-Docs:
  - **Academy of Threads:** A school-themed guild focused on teaching abilities and upgrades.
  - **Sundered Houses:** A competitive guild with a split focus on melee vs. magic, combining lodge and tower concepts.
  - **Applied Development Consortium:** An engineering-skunkworks styled guild with distinct specialized departments.

- Guilds have been requested to be moved to Lore Review before being voted on.

---

## Anomalies
- Work is underway on a clinical-style lore post for rift lore, particularly for anomalies such as **Rift Tears**
- Link will be included for Contributors posts and are asked to give feedback and thumbs up to endorse.
- Rift Tears serve as one base anomaly type, other types for future expansion.

### Anomaly Design Expansion
- Discussed new anomaly types to enrich rift gameplay beyond objectives:
  - Altar exchanges (offering → reward).
  - Loot goblin bombs that spawn from huts.
  - Floating pedestals from thorny puffers.
  - Out-of-place creatures like **umber plankton**.
- Inspired by shrines from other ARPGs and pylons from Vault Hunters.
- Some 3x3 POIs may be replaced to improve risk vs. reward.

---

## Hub World
- Ownership transferred due to assignee unavailability.
- A call for feedback and final submissions is ongoing.
- Intention is to extract common elements and hold votes on specific components rather than whole concepts.
- Several submissions exist (e.g., nautical cities, floating islands).
- Leadership delay cited for holding up the vote on game design element; summer availability and process familiarity are factors.
- Framework will enable progression in other connected features.

---

## Other Updates
- Notes on contributor availability and climate-related delays.
- Brief digressions on Starry Valley crops and contributor errands.
- Contributors encouraged to read full writeups in Wotr-Docs.

### Design Meeting Planning
- A design meeting is being rescheduled (likely Saturday) to accommodate more attendees.
- Goal is to define core game type and major mechanics before lore solidifies too far ahead.
- Request made to stagger the design meeting to avoid back-to-back burnout with other meetings.

---

## Closing Points
- All key topics were covered, including Ability Guilds, Anomalies, and Hub World.
- Additional clarifications and Q&A were offered after a short break.
- Next steps include moving forward with Lore Review, resolving votes, and progressing toward game design alignment.

# RECAP

---

## Essence System & Force Chart
- **Essence** defined as matter comprising the interdimensional universe.
- A vote on Essence categorization ended in a tie; it remains unresolved.
- Three different Essence Force Charts were proposed:
  - One currently in the MVP.
  - One based on block origin.
  - One with a color-coded logic map.
- Game Mechanic of essence remains undecided (e.g., factory-like usage, crafting systems).

---

## Essence Creation Guild
- Guild role includes:
  - Creating rift keys.
  - Explaining how essence is gathered and used.
  - Possibly tied to Sages or Endermen-inspired lore.
- Alternative submissions and concepts being merged or compared (e.g., Octet guild).

---

## Gem Garner Guild & Greebles
- Greebles are being reconsidered in guild design to reduce overuse and typecasting.
- Proposals include:
  - Greebles as helpers, not loot goblins.
  - New creatures like collector birds or mole miners to lead the guild.
  - Greebles acting as sheep-like creatures shepherded by the guild.

### Never People & Rune Gems
- Concept introduced of beings who can willingly choose not to exist, confusing the universe and allowing them to manipulate raw essence into rune gems.
- These “Never People” interact with the underlying structure of reality rather than using magic.
- Introduced the idea of **Void Emeralds**, raw essence crystals harvested from rifts and processed into rune gems.

---

## Campaigns
- Introduced narrative campaigns akin to D&D arcs: tight, focused stories set within the world.
- Intended to offer structure while leaving the broader world open-ended.

---

## Additional Guild Submissions
- **Bright Atelier:** Tailor mice guild that fit skills to players like clothing.
- **Ladies of the Line:** Magical girl fashion-themed guild using enchanted parasols and dresses as weapons.
- **Felt:** A hive-minded Muppet-like species controlled by a fungus brain. 

---

## Lore & Material
- Ongoing work on **Material Lore** to justify custom blocks (e.g., “why not use normal gold?”).
- Aimed to inspire mechanics and crafting recipes.
- Gathers flavor text and mod-specific context for new materials.

---

## Greebles
- Art team expressed concerns over Greebles becoming loot goblins in lore.
- Plan to decouple them and pursue alternate concepts to realign with original art intent.

---

## Sages
- Sages' role remains undefined:
  - Are they gods, spiritual guides, or reincarnated avatars?
- Deferred to backlog until game design approval is completed.
