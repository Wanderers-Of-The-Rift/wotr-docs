## Founders and the Hub World

### Mythic Origins of the Hub
- A proposed legend tells of the **Dark Ages** when the multiverse was ruled by strength and violence.
- A group known as the **Founders** rose up, defeated tyrants, and established a **neutral safe zone** now known as the Hub.
- Historical or mythological level figures that are generally regarded as heroes
- There to support any existing lore in regards to campaigns or background of the hub
- The hub as a city exists because of them

### Founders' Legacy
- Suggested presence of an **Order** devoted to the Founders’ ideals:
  - Protect the weak.
  - Prevent abuse of power.
  - Maintain balance and neutrality within the Hub.

### Leadership in the Hub
- Discussion over whether a **leader or elder** figure should exist:
  - Could take the form of Elizabeth or elder advisor.
  - Caution expressed around conflicting with the theme of shared power or undermining player agency.
- The Hub is understood to be built through **guild collaboration**, not ruled by a single authority.

## Narrative Delivery

### Storytelling Approach
- Agreement to **avoid overly detailed canon early on**.
- Suggest working with **modular, connected concepts** that form a coherent story over time.
- Suggested model: 'Until Dawn' style storytelling where players piece together lore over time.
- Favor expressed for a **“retirement home of adventurers”** tone over a detailed epic.

### Lore Implementation
- Use **collectibles** (e.g. scrolls or pages found in Rifts) to drip-feed reliable lore pieces.
- Centralized lore display area planned within the Hub World.
- Avoid disjointed standalone ideas. Favor worldbuilding that emerges from connected systems.

### Puzzle Piece Method
- Suggested story-building process:
  - Start with individual ideas.
  - Connect them as shared structures and lore needs develop.
- Acknowledge that standalone campaign storylines (e.g. Essence Guild, Sages) may not align at first but can later be unified.

### Limits on Lore Exposure to Players
- Players will likely only see **snippets**, not full histories.
- Dialogue, short descriptions, and discovered objects will serve as primary storytelling tools.
- Extensive backstory will exist behind the scenes but isn’t expected to be fully visible in gameplay.
- Lore should be developed even if subject to change: “everything might change, but we still work on it today.”

---

### Task Development
- Proposed creating a **running list of lore questions**:
  - What are Rifts?
  - Why are there chests and POIs?
  - Who built the Hub?
- Maintain a “**currently accepted answer**” list for evolving story beats that aren’t yet canon.

## Other Notes

### Merging Ideas
- Discussion on tying the **Essence Guild**, **tutorial NPCs**, and the **Sages** into one cohesive concept.
- Sages may be reframed as ancient figures tied to Essence Weaving and Rift stabilization.
- A Proposed tutorial concept aligns with this direction, incorporating the Sages or retired heroes.

### Ability Creation Guild Voting
- **Academy of Threads** won the community vote with 63%.
- Will be moved forward to **Lore Review** and **Canon consideration**.
- Next steps: support for art and build asset planning, as well as narrative documentation.

### Greebles Reevaluation
- Continued discussion on **scaling back Greebles** as the core identity of too many systems.
- Exploring alternatives to fill roles previously tied to Greebles.

### Playtesting
- Proposed a fun **"race to the Rift"** playtest:
  - Goal: determine if current systems (recipes, equipment) make early progression clear and enjoyable.
  - One player completed a first Rift in 30 minutes using current test data.

### Tutorials and Development Timing
- Tutorials likely be built late in development to avoid rework from evolving systems.
- Final tutorials may depend on questing or guild systems, which are still being developed.

## Closing & Next Steps
- **Open Ideas Post** needed for **Guild Rift Rooms** mentioned in roadmap
- Move **Academy of Threads** to **Lore Review**

- Group agreed to **wait one week** before launching a new survey or changing cadence.
- General encouragement to **keep developing lore** even if systems shift
- Vibe check indicated productive
