### Focus
- Phase Two focuses on **visual structure and layout** of the Hub World.
- Goal: consolidate submissions, explore viable layouts, and identify shared design elements

## Hub Layout Concepts

### Disc Platform
- Inner ring: refined and planned.
- Outer edge: chaotic, expanding over time.
- Pillars:
  - **Stability:** Disc core is permanent.
  - **Memory:** Hub holds fragments of the past.
  - **Growth:** Additions built as needed.

### Floating Islands
- Expands dynamically with unique, themed islands.
- Bridges/portals connect locations.
- Pillars:
  - **Stability:** Interisland network remains intact.
  - **Community:** Player shaped development.
  - **Many Stories:** Each island is distinct.

### Networked Archipelago
- Individual islands in separate bubbles linked by teleportation or portals.
- Self-managed by different groups.
- Pillars:
  - **Stability:** Portal system unifies the Hub.
  - **Community:** Trust based connectivity.
  - **Many Stories:** Total visual and thematic variance.

### City in a Cave / Port Town
- Compact vertical builds and tight streets.
- Not necessarily underground despite the name.
- Pillars:
  - **Stability:** Dense city structure.
  - **Community:** Trade, diplomacy, cooperation.
  - **Many Stories:** Cultural diversity across neighborhoods.

## Combined Approach
- Discussion explored blending layouts:
  - A **central disc or island** as the oldest area.
  - **Branching out** to islands or expansions via bridges or portals.
  - Natural progression from tightly packed areas to larger, more organized zones.
- Strong support for combining the emotional warmth of cave builds with the scalability of floating islands

---

## Technical Considerations
- Discussion around **void world vs. cave generation**:
  - Void world offers greater control and fewer technical hurdles.
  - A cave doesnâ€™t imply "dark and dingy"; it can be bright and full of life.
- Rift room structure could be repurposed for portal or district connections.

## Closing & Next Steps
- write up a draft for merging hub world layout concepts.
