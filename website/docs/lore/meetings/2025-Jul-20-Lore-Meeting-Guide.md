# Hubworld Lore : What the Hub *Means* (Phase 1)

Collaborative lore session!

Companion guide to help follow along during meeting. Reference to explore what the Hubworld *means*.

---

## Goal

NOT designing the Hub’s layout or choosing a name.

Answering more important question:

> **What does the Hub *represent* to the people who live there and to us?**

Shared ideas we all agree are part of its identity. *Narrative truths* NOT gameplay mechanics

---

## Draft Core Lore Truths (a.k.a. "Pillars")

Recurring ideas that showed up across everyone's submissions:

### 1. **The Hub is Stability in the Chaos**

### 2. **It Thrives Because of Connection**

### 3. **It Remembers Lost Things**

### 4. **It’s Still Being Built**

### 5. **It’s Made of Many Stories**

### 6. **It’s Becoming Something New**

## Next

Next Phase focus on physical shape of the Hub:
- Rift access styles
- Guild layouts
- District types
- How the Hub grows
- Daily life and weird details
