## Anomaly Concepts
- Aiming to prepare for an upcoming vote on the simplest concept suitable for an MVP.
- Discussion emphasized merging similar ideas into a unified concept:
    - Fragments of other dimensions consumed by the rift.
    - Dimensions trying to stitch themselves into the rift to open gateways.
    - Pieces of other worlds partially embedded in the rift.
    - Rifts that bleed alternate themes.
- Effects of interacting with anomalies could include:
    - Closing a rift before it stabilizes might release energy granting a buff.
    - Cutting threads may cause them to disintegrate, covering the player in rift energy.
    - Disrupting fragmented realities could unleash displaced energy affecting the player.
- Agreed to initially keep anomalies simple for the MVP, leaving more complex events (like mini-events with trapped shrines or enemy spawns) for later development.
- Suggested canonizing anomalies broadly as *“anything inside a Rift that seems out of place and can be interacted with,”* keeping the category open for future additions.

## Lore and Design Process for Anomalies
- A summary incorporating these concepts will be drafted and posted in Lore topics for review.
- Planned to finalize the concept in the Wednesday meeting if no major objections arise.
- Once approved, it will move to Lore Review for grammar and editorial checks.

---

## Hub World and Sages
- Progress noted on the Hub World, which is moving forward to a vote.
- Sages content is deprioritized; suggested to leave unassigned and tag as backlog since it may not be foundational.

---

## Story Voting Improvements
- Proposed refining Discord voting to allow multiple selections, merging top choices to better represent collective preferences.
- Seen as a way to avoid anyone feeling excluded and to produce a more realistic read on favored options.

---

## Rifts in Lore
- Discussed refining the lore definition of **Rifts**.
- Left intentionally broad to encourage player interpretation while still providing a narrative base.

---

## Game Design

### Project Identity
- Raised concern that lacking a clear identity is causing scattered priorities, advocating for a sharper focus like a curated menu—“everything games lose definition and don’t do anything well.”

### Scheduling Next Design Discussion
- The Essence system will be put on hold until a dedicated game design meeting clarifies structure and purpose.
- Next meeting is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, focusing specifically on the Essence system.

### ARPG vs. Farming Pack Direction
- Suggested leaning more toward an ARPG-style pack rather than a heavily farming- or factory-focused experience.
- Recognized original intent as a spiritual successor to Vault Hunters with factory elements, but stressed caution against extensive production lines.

---

## Lore, Gameplay & Inter-team Alignment
- Expressed importance of having lore, art, and gameplay development aligned from the start to enable other teams to work efficiently.
- Example: if the Hub World vote passes, having supporting story and lore prepared so build and art teams can immediately begin.

---

## Guild Discussions
### Guild Submissions & Concepts
- Combining concepts from multiple contributors into three primary guilds intended for 0.2.0:
    - **Gem Guild:** 
    - **Ability Guild:** 
    - **Essence Guild:** 

- Current approach is to move all three guild concepts to Lore Review, with a vote to determine which becomes the Ability Creation and Enhancement Guild. Remaining ideas would still be documented for potential future use.

### Essence Guild Considerations
- Noted Essence Guild has received little feedback and questioned if it should exist as a guild or if its core purpose should be redefined.
- Guild should clearly tie into gameplay systems:
    - **Essence Guild:** overseeing essence, Rift Key Forge, and thematic objectives around essence.

## Alternate Concepts
- Suggested exploring a “sciency” angle for the Essence Guild, with a plan to wrap this up for a vote by next Sunday.

---

## Rune Gems & Gem Guild
- Desire to build out the **Gem Guild** more robustly, moving away from heavy dependence on Greebles.
- Discussed past concept of Gem Garners involving Greebles receiving rune gems, evolving toward new directions.

### Greebles and Rebalancing
- Debated how Greebles have been stretched into too many roles, recommending:
    - Removing their function as loot goblins and wandering traders.
    - Considering them instead as neutral creatures drawn to rune gems, helping players locate geodes in rifts.
- Proposed making new species for different functions (e.g., crow aristocrats, rock or mole species for guild purposes).

### Greeble Biology & Lore
- Ideas include:
    - Greebles constructing woven silk shells that, if broken, cause their death.
    - Possibly collected like shepherding livestock, harvesting shells after they pass on.

---

## Hub World Revisited
- Multiple Hub World proposals exist (city with shops, floating islands, living forests with info-traveling trees).
- Plan is to consolidate common elements and finalize a coherent concept.
- A final call for additional submissions will be posted with a 48-hour window to close remaining gaps.

---

## Additional Ideas & Light Topics
- Explored quirky concept of a species appearing as extremely old from birth: women like hags, men as bearded wizards.
---

## Closing Points
- Meeting wrapped with an aim to have notes written and posted within 24 hours.
- Next meeting to continue Wednesday.
