## Focus
- Defining **narrative identity** for the Hub World.
- A game design pitch vote on the Hub World is currently in progress (87% in favor).
- **Phase One** of Hub World development: defining the **core truths** or **pillars** that shape the Hub's meaning, not its content.
- Discussion aimed to build a framework incorporating existing submissions and ideas

## Suggested Pillars of the Hub World

### 1. A Stable Place in a Shifting Multiverse
- The Hub remains constant while the Rifts and multiverse around it shift.
- May need clarification; suggestion to rephrase as “shifting Rifts” rather than multiverse.
- Overworld dimensions and dimensions that other species come from may be considered stable.

### 2. Community-Built and Maintained
- The Hub runs on collective effort, built and sustained by wanderers and guilds.
- No singular figure defines it.

### 3. A Place of Remembrance
- The Hub holds memories, relics, and cultural fragments from lost or changed worlds.
- Could support features like a museum or archive.
- Serves as a living record of what once was.

### 4. Ever-Evolving
- The Hub is actively growing and never finished.
- Started by myths or sages, but continues evolving.
- Supports in-game elements like upgrading guilds, transforming buildings, or phased growth.

### 5. A Patchwork of Stories
- Reflects diverse styles, races, and stories.
- Built from mixed materials, guild influences, and cultural echoes.
- Accepts overlapping aesthetics and flexible design.

### 6. A Place of Possibility
- Balances hope and hardship.
- Not all residents are fleeing danger, some are chasing opportunity.
- The Hub isn’t just fortress or sanctuary also a launchpad for potential.
- Safe zone in gameplay, though NPCs may express concerns about stability.

## Narrative Design Principles

### Contradictory Lore Perspectives
- NPCs may hold conflicting beliefs (e.g., scientific vs. religious explanations of Rifts).
- Players experience **multiple truths**, with no single definitive answer.
- Canon may exist in ancient texts or ruins but not be reflected in dialog.
- Allows for diverse worldviews based on species, dimension, or experience.

### Hub as Separate Dimension
- Technically implemented as its own dimension.
- Provides full design control and allows lore-based justifications for version changes.
- Mirrors the evolving nature of the real-life community and content development.

## Pillar Discussion & Preferences
- Contributors shared which pillar resonated most:
    - **#4 (Ever-Evolving):** supported by Kiara and Wout.
    - **#2 and #6 (Community & Possibility):** preferred by Mumar, themed as "hope."
    - **#1 (Stability):** also supported by Mumar and Rachel.
    - **#5 (Patchwork):** preferred by Warren.
    - **#6 (Possibility):** favored by Sp3cialk for a more upbeat tone.
- Intention is to use all six pillars, with flexibility for phrasing and detail.

---

## Phase One Summary
- Phase one focused on defining **narrative truths** and **foundational tone** for the Hub.
- These will serve as **taglines** and be expanded upon in formal lore entries.
- Example clarification: taglines are like slide titles; expanded content will follow.

---

## Phase Two Preview
- Will involve categorizing submission elements such as:
    - Guilds
    - Districts
    - Portal styles
    - Growth methods
- Goal is to create a **matrix** or **chart** to unify submissions into a shared Hub design.

## Music
- A temporary audio track for the Hub was shared in Lore General (WAV format).
- A full post will follow in the Art section for feedback and theme discussion.

---

## Closing & Next Steps
- Phase One is complete; with some minor phrasing and clarification to be reviewed
- Official submission draft will be reworked offline.
- Phase Two will begin structuring environmental and design elements based on collective submissions.
- Continued emphasis on collaborative building and openness to multi-voiced lore.
