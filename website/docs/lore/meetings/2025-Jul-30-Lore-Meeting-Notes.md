## Red Tide

### Red Tide as Mythic Contributors
- The **Red Tide** are a legendary group tied to Hubworld
- Historically feared as violent warriors “an ocean of blood followed them”
- Reframed as ambiguous heroes who dismantled a power hierarchy and earned political capital
- Names are being revised for **cultural diversity** and narrative flexibility
- Published a new Red Tide post and encouraged collaboration
- The term “Founders” was avoided due to baggage; “Red Tide” is title subject to change

### Tone and Integration
- Red Tide are **contributors**, not sole architects of the Hub.
- The story remains open-ended: did they really exist or are they mythologized figures?

## Lore 

### Lore vs. Worldbuilding
- Differentiated **worldbuilding** (locations, systems) from **lore** (historical events, characters)
- Expected that 80% of lore may not appear directly in-game
- Players will engage with lore through discovered fragments, not walls of text
- Devlogs, lore archives, or even webpage may house expanded background info

## Hubworld Rift Access

### Rift Entry Systems
- Several models proposed:
  - **Central Rift Tower**: ancient uncontrollable in the Hub's center
  - **Anchor Portals**: stable return points, tuned by wanderers
  - **Crafted Keys**: personal items bound to return points
  - **Guild-Specific Gates**: separate entrances managed by guilds
  - **Perimeter Rifts**: access points around the Hub’s edge

### Suggested Direction
- Favoring **stable anchor portals** and **guild-access zones** for structure and multiplayer clarity
- Portal size could reflect rift tier or complexity

### Integration with Existing Concepts
- Hub should serve as a **centralized location**, not fragmented across isolated islands
- Compromise idea:
  - Central island with bridged or teleported islands for guilds or personal

### Cosmological Model
- Proposed **black hole model**:
  - Rift space = inside the singularity
  - Material planes = outside in the accretion disk
  - Hubworld = in-between material planes and the Rift space: black space within the Event Horizon
  - Portals lead inward toward increasingly unstable zones

## Other Notes

### Canon Process & Rune Gems
- Rune gems derived from a fusion of runewords and gems
- Lore additions should **align with existing canon** unless a broader rewrite is discussed
- Suggested working on unexplained features first, rather than revisiting settled concepts
- Evolution of mechanics may open future opportunities for pivoting lore

### Additional Topics
- Building ruins in the Hub was discussed; lore context (ancient or extradimensional) could remain ambiguous

## Closing & Next Steps
- Encouraged to think on unanswered questions
- Engage with any post you feel interesting and/or enjoyable

- Plan on continuing next meeting with Hubworld Phase 2, 'growth' and 'central landmark'
