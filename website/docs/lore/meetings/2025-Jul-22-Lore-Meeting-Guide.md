# Hubworld Lore : How the Hub *Takes Shape* (Phase 2)

Submitted ideas in categories to help blend, vote, and build Hub or remix

Multiple options in each, simply, with references

---

## Goal

NOT deciding lore canon or picking “best” submissions.

> **How do the ideas from Phase 1 show up in the design of the Hub?**

Structural and narrative choices. All options here reflect someone's vision. *connect, combine, and collaborate*

|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Disk Platform (Layered Build)** | A flat disk where older buildings are near the center and newer builds are cramped outward or hang underneath. | *Hub Info*, *Wanderer’s Landing* |
| **Floating Islands (Organic Growth)** | Sky islands connected by bridges. New islands appear as needs arise. Each one looks different. | *Sanctuary*, *Chrysalis* |
| **City in a Cave / Port Town** | A densely packed trade hub built into a stable cavern. Filled with docks, vertical buildings, and cultural mix. | *Port Pharus*, *Galactic* |
| **Networked Archipelago** | The Hub is actually a network of small islands connected by portal “seeds.” Each guild or player controls one. | *Archipelago*, *Zing* |
