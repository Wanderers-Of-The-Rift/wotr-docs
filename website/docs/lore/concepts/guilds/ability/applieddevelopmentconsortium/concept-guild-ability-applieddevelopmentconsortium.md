## Lore

The emergence of Rifts across various worlds brought with it unprecedented opportunities for those with the right mindset. A group of innovators recognized that the dimensional phenomena represented more than just strange occurrences; they were systematic challenges that could be approached with methodical, practical solutions. The energies flowing through Rifts weren't just altering the physical form of materials, but could also be used to enhance and improve the capabilities of individuals. Expanding on this they were revealing entirely new possibilities for refined development and applied methodologies.

Various organizations began to recognize the value of coordinated effort in this new field. The Applied Development Consortium formed through the voluntary merger of several groups, pooling resources, expertise, and development capabilities to tackle the complex challenges presented by dimensional phenomena. Other guilds discover capabilities that align with their particular domains. The Consortium became dedicated to collecting, studying, and developing all abilities regardless of their origin or initial discovery.

The Consortium's departments understood that the scope of capabilities required unprecedented coordination between applied specialties. They established a centralized complex where different development and innovation specialties could work in parallel while sharing resources, facilities, and practical breakthroughs. This collaborative approach proved valuable as innovators discovered that abilities, by way of dimensional mechanics and Rift phenomena, could all be methodically developed, modified, and optimized through proper applied methods.

## Story
Developmental Refiner Freeman stepped away from the resonance chamber, its containment field humming with carefully controlled energy. Around him the main floor bustled with coordinated activity. Artisans from different departments collaborated on projects, floating diagrams showing reports from field tests, and the ambient hum of calibration devices.

The communication pipes carried a message: "Freeman, your wanderer is here for the ability integration session in Refinement Workshop Three."

The route to Refinement Workshop Three led through corridors lined with viewing windows. These offered glimpses of ongoing work: assembly of modular enhancement systems, specialists stress-testing new advancement protocols, and innovators fine-tuning equipment of unknown potential that pulsed and added the shimmer of energy in the air.

On arrival Freeman was met by a wanderer and a guild member from another department. The wanderer's kinetic manipulation abilities had been steadily growing but lacked focused development. "We've completed the applied ability analysis you requested," Freeman explained, gesturing to a sophisticated array of equipment. "We've designed a systematic approach specifically for your ability profile." "The really interesting part," added the other guild member, "is that our field testing suggests this won't just help you advance your current abilities. The system is designed to identify and cultivate potential you haven't even discovered yet."

The wanderer examined the enhancement setup, noting the precise craftsmanship and methodical approach. "You can actually help me develop abilities I don't know I have?"

"We can help you explore and advance your full potential," Freeman replied, beginning the calibration process. "Every session teaches us more about applied ability improvement. What we learn from working with you helps us refine better methodologies for the next wanderer who requests our expertise."
