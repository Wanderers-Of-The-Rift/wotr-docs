# Gem Stewards (Gem Guild)
---
## Guild Name
Gem Stewards

---
## Lore

The Gem Stewards formed from a small community of individuals who shared several key traits: a natural fascination with shiny, beautiful objects; an unexpected fondness for the innocent, ceramic-bodied greebles; the patience and skill needed to care for these fragile creatures; and the practical knowledge of gem extraction and handling.

These weren't necessarily professional miners or creature handlers initially: they were individuals who found themselves drawn to both the aesthetic beauty of gems and the endearing simplicity of greebles. Some might have been artisans who appreciated fine stones, others could have been wanderers who kept rescued greebles as companions, and still others might have been practical folk who simply enjoyed working with their hands and caring for vulnerable creatures.

What brought them together was the realization that they shared this unusual combination of interests and skills. They discovered that their individual knowledge complemented each other perfectly: one individual's gem extraction expertise, another's greeble husbandry experience, a third's understanding of gem quality.

The guild formed organically as these like-minded individuals began collaborating, sharing techniques, and eventually establishing a more formal structure around their shared passions and complementary abilities.

---
## Explanation
The Gem Stewards operates as both sanctuary and service provider, built around the shared passions of its members for gleaming gems and endearing greebles. Guild members venture into rifts to rescue wild greebles from dangerous environments, guiding these vulnerable beings to safer areas where they can thrive among gem deposits without threat from hostile creatures.

The guild's primary service emerges naturally from this care focused approach. When wanderers bring raw or unsatisfactory gems to the guild, different breeds of greebles can perform various processing techniques through their natural feeding behaviors. This creates a beneficial cycle: wanderers receive improved gems, greebles get nourishment from processing the stones, and the guild maintains its role in the dimensional economy.

Guild members combine their individual specialties into a cohesive operation. Those with mining expertise handle gem extraction and evaluation, while others focus on greeble husbandry. Through daily interaction with both greebles and gems, all members develop understanding of gem quality and optimal processing approaches.

## Story
The morning mist clung to the guild's terraced mineral gardens as Keeper Allira made her rounds, checking on the various flocks scattered throughout the stepped outcroppings. Exposed gem veins glittered in the early light, and she paused at the sight of three greebles contentedly clustered around a deposit, their ceramic shells gleaming with faint mineral traces from recent work.

"There's my little troublemaker," she murmured, watching as the smallest greeble enthusiastically bounced toward a shiny specimen, only to faceplant directly into it with a soft ceramic clink. The gem vanished into the darkness of its hollow face, and moments later, a new gem popped out.

A wanderer approached, carrying a satchel of freshly mined gems. "I heard your greebles could help me with these," they said, gesturing toward the satchel.

Allira's eyes lit up as she peered into the satchel. "Oh, look at these beauties! This one's got such beautiful flash... and these smaller ones have interesting seams!" She practically bounced on her toes. "Gouger would absolutely love working with this shin cracker." She nodded toward the robust greeble. "A couple of these look like fizzers that could benefit from a second chance. And these delicate little gems... perfect for them over there. They're much gentler with the smaller gems."

Sensing her excitement, one of the indicated greebles waddled forward, its simple features somehow conveying eager anticipation despite having no real expression to speak of.

## Hierarchy / Structure
Curious → Familiar → Trusted → Valued → Cherished

The guild operates under the guidance of experienced Keepers who have mastered both greeble care and gem processing expertise. Day-to-day operations are handled by Wardens and Minders who focus primarily on flock management and creature welfare, working alongside Stewards who specialize in assessment, conditioning, and processing services. New members typically begin by learning fundamental skills before advancing to more specialized roles based on their interests and aptitudes.

## Symbol / Banner / Colors
The guild's symbol features nested polyhedral shapes of increasing complexity, representing the multifaceted nature of both gems and their work. The geometric forms shift through prismatic hues that catch and reflect light from different angles, creating a colorful display that mirrors the gems. This rainbow effect symbolizes the guild's appreciation for all varieties of gems.

Guild banners are crafted in the distinctive grey-green of greeble shells, providing a muted backdrop that allows the prismatic symbol to stand out prominently. The banner material itself has a subtle ceramic-like texture, honoring their charges while maintaining the practical durability needed for daily use. When displayed, the symbols shimmer as light plays across their surfaces, creating an almost hypnotic effect that draws the eye. This visual appeal perfectly captures the guild's natural attraction to anything that gleams and sparkles.

## Base of Operations

The guild's sanctuary features terraced mineral gardens where greebles can roam safely among modest gem formations. Stepped outcroppings cascade down gentle slopes, providing pathways for guild members and ceramic-bodied inhabitants alike. Small mineral traces are scattered throughout the terraces, providing basic sustenance for the greebles while maintaining the peaceful environment guild members cherish.

Processing areas are built into the natural landscape with comfortable chambers where different greeble breeds work alongside Stewards and Wardens. These spaces emphasize gentle lighting and cushioned surfaces for comfort during daily operations. Discrete storage areas for gems are integrated seamlessly into the architecture, maintaining security while preserving accessibility.

Common areas include resting spaces where greebles can cluster together, and workshop spaces where guild members assess gems and coordinate expeditions to expand and graze their flocks. The overall atmosphere remains peaceful and pastoral, filled with the gentle ceramic sounds of greebles going about their daily activities and the quiet conversations of guild members caring for both critters and gems.

## Reputation / Public Perception
The guild is generally viewed as patient and caring specialists who work with creatures most people recognize but few would want to manage themselves. The members' obvious affection for the simple-minded creatures is endearing, and the guild's calm, thoughtful approach is appreciated. Wanderers typically find the devotion to greebles endearing or amusing, though they all find the peaceful surroundings genuinely relaxing.

## Notable Members or History
**Keeper Bindi** first identified that different greeble breeds exhibited distinct interactions with gems, leading to the specialized processing techniques the guild employs. With boundless enthusiasm and patient observation, Bindi would spend entire days quietly watching greebles. She documented their subtle behaviors with meticulous care, celebrating each small discovery about their preferences and personalities. Her work established the foundation for understanding greeble-gem relationships.

**The Muster of Many** became a turning point that established the guild's credibility. During this large-scale drive from a rift, dozens of greebles were found scattered around gem deposits throughout the area. This roundup operation not only formed the core of the guild's current flocks but demonstrated their expertise in both creature care and rift operations, gaining recognition as a legitimate guild as opposed to grouped enthusiasts.

The development of the **terraced habitat** emerged from understanding how greebles naturally thrived in gem-rich environments. This innovation created safe, sustainable spaces that mirror the mineral formations where greebles feel most comfortable, establishing the foundation for the guild's current sanctuary design.
