# Wanderers of the Rift

## Who we are

Wanderers of the Rift (WotR) is a new Minecraft modpack in the ARPG-pack genre. This is a community driven and developed project likely to end up in 1.22 Neoforge Minecraft.

## Our values

We are building Wanderers of the Rift and Builders of the Rift as a community driven, open source project rooted in trust, creativity, and shared purpose. 
These values guide how we collaborate and what we’re creating together:

### Open source
Both mods are licensed under AGPL-3.0, ensuring that the source code remains freely available, forkable, and open to the public.

### Accessibility
We are committed to including accessibility features wherever possible so that a wide range of players can enjoy the mod.

### Play your own way
We believe players should be free to express themselves through gameplay. 
Our design avoids forcing specific styles or solutions and instead encourages creativity and exploration.

## How we build

### Open idea contribution
Anyone in the project can share ideas through our forums and channels. 
We’re working to make the contribution process more streamlined and inclusive over time.

### Distributed leadership
We operate through shared leadership among core contributors who share direction and decision making responsibilities. 
Gameplay and content decisions are guided by the coordination team and community while organizational processes are led by the elected/appointed leadership team. 
While leadership defines key processes, contributor feedback is always welcome and encouraged.

### Transparency
We value transparency as a foundation for trust. 
This includes openness around decisions, development progress, and financial matters, while still respecting privacy, boundaries, and project roles
