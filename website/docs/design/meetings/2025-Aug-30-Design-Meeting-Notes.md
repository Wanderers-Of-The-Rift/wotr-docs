## [Visual Working Board PDF](/other-files/meeting-notes/Visual-Working-Board-8-30-25.pdf)

## Meeting Format
- Meeting included:
  - Idea sharing (15 minutes)
  - Weekly focus topic (30 minutes)
  - Review of existing and in-progress ideas (15 Minutes)

## Itemization
- Desire to bring up itemization specifically armor
- Itemization is a very big topic and the "heartbeat of an arpg"
- suggested waiting until more people are present

## Guide System

### System Approach
Technical Implementation
- WotR Quest System: Currently supports random, repeatable bounty/reputation quests
- Patchouli Guidebook: Primary tool for tutorial and progression guidance
- Separate Systems: Bounty quests vs story/tutorial quests serve different purposes
- Data Pack Integration: Allows flexible content addition and experimentation

Quest Categories
- Bounty/Task Quests: Random, repeatable (current WotR system)
- Story Quests: Linear progression
- Guidebook: Step-by-step progression without forced reading

### Guidebook
Content Strategy
- Stopgap Solution: Until public release, potentially permanent
- JEI Integration: "Craft this item" rather than detailed ingredient lists
- Minimal Verbosity: Simple steps, rely on existing game systems
- Lore Integration: Use existing lore team definitions and content

Guidebook Structure
Core Subjects:
- General welcome to the modpack
- What to do in rifts
- Skill bench mechanics
- Rune gems and anvil usage
- Mob info and spawner mechanics
- Armor types and implicits

Key Forge:
- Key Forge crafting
- Key creation
- Rift Spawner crafting
- Key + Rift Spawner usage
- Enter Rift

### Rift Systems Explanation
Core Loop
- Primary Goal: Loot acquisition (geodes and skill threads)
- Progression Chain: Loot → Ability Bench → Rune Anvil → Character improvement
One working objective, brainstorming posts for additional objectives

Essential Knowledge
Armor System:
- Different armor types have different implicits
    - Gold armor: mana regen
    - Diamond armor: armor toughness
    - Iron armor: armor toughness

Equipment Recommendations:
- Wear complete armor set when entering rifts
- Carry backpacks for loot management
- Understand upgrade systems

"Useful to Know" Section
- Backpack usage and upgrades
- Ability crafting, equipping, and cycling mechanics
- Rune anvil interaction

### Content
Lore Integration
- Limitations: 20-30 word limit for lore flavor text
- Focus Priority: Clear instruction over lore for tutorial content
- Reusable Content: Leverage existing lore team definitions

### Core Objective
Work with existing systems to create content comprehensible beyond just project contributors
Provide basic guide information for entry and gameplay understanding
- Essential Information Only: Focus on what players need to progress
- Temporary but Potentially Permanent: Guidebook approach may become standard
- Clear Instruction Priority: Tutorial clarity over narrative complexity

## Additional Topics

### Bestiary System
- Could fall into 'guide' territory

### Smithing Templates
- Mentioned for armor enhancement, needs elaboration

### Chest Slicing
- Making chests entities could cause performance issues
