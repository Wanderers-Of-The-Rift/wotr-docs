## Meeting Format
- Meeting included:
  - Idea sharing (15 minutes)
  - Weekly focus topic (30 minutes)
  - Review of existing and in-progress ideas (15 Miuntes)

## Wanderer's Charm
- The **Wanderer's Charm** pitch allows teleportation from the Overworld to the Rift Hub
- Proposed as a **simple MVP**: triggers a teleport command
- Intention is to **reduce travel friction** and streamline returning to the Hub

## Hunger Based Regen & Sustenance System

### Regen Discussion
- Sparked by Warren’s proposal to revise hunger mechanics.
- Summary of discussion:
  - Exploration of removing hunger and armor
  - Vanilla hunger/saturation mechanics clarified
  - Compared with other games: *Core Keeper*, *Terraria*, *Monster Hunter*, *BOTW*, *Last Epoch*, *PoE*.
- Dungeon Meshi Inspiration
  - Referenced **Dungeon Meshi**, an anime focused on cooking monsters
  - Inspired the idea of **mob drops as ingredients**

### Proposed System: Sustenance & Support
- **Meals (Provisions)**:
  - Refill hunger bar in Rifts, functioning like **stamina restoration** but automatic
- **Rift Refreshments**:
  - Inspired by tea shop concept, supplements Provisions incorporates potions and buffs
- **Stat-Based Regen**:
  - Passive health regen in Rifts tied to attributes instead of saturation
- Goal: make food and drink **strategically meaningful** while improving QoL

## Game Pillars: Core Concepts

### Pillar Overview
- Definition: "A pillar is a core value or concept that defines the game, not a mechanic."
- Target: 2–3 primary pillars, with a **hard max of 6** to avoid redundancy or contradiction.

### Pillars Reviewed and Drafted

**Evolving Simplicity**
  - Start simple; layer complexity over time
  - Example: socketing, fishing, ability mods
  - Must support both new and long-term players

**More Than Just Numbers**
  - Combat shouldn’t be about pure min-maxing
  - Stats should interact with elements (e.g., water conducts electricity)
  - Planning, synergy, and strategy should matter

**Players Shape Their Path**
  - No strict classes or enforced questlines
  - Players choose builds and progression styles (mage, rogue, builder, etc.)
  - Supported by:
    - Flexible build swapping
    - Optional quests
    - Skippable tutorials

## Pillar Refinement & Consolidation

- Discussion around **overlap** among proposed values:
  - “Let the Player Play” = sandbox freedom, no restrictive handholding
  - “Respect the Player” = minimize downtime and time gates
  - “Flexible Meaningful Builds” = avoid meta-locks and dead paths
  - “Combinable Combat Archetypes” = warrior-mage hybrids, no locked class roles

- Suggested merges:
  - Combine **“Evolving Simplicity” + “Extra Challenges”** into a single growth-focused pillar.
  - Merge “Synergies not Classes,” “Freedom of Loadouts,” and “Combinable Archetypes.”

## Additional Design Values Submitted

- **Risk Provides Reward** – Extra challenge yields stronger returns.
- **Non-Gated Gameplay** – Minimize barriers to play or progression.
- **Narrative Without Story** – Lore can be present without scripted sequences.
- **Embrace Minecraft as a Game** – The modpack should leverage Minecraft deeply, not layer over it.
- **Minimized Required Downtime** – Shorten re-entry time between Rifts.

## Grouping

- Plan to **group similar ideas**, write them up, and share as a post for team feedback
- Will synthesize overlapping themes and clarify distinctions
- Final goal: produce a small number of powerful, flexible pillars
