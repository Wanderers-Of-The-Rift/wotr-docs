## Genre
- Ongoing clarification of what kind of game is being built. Described as:
  - **Action RPG** with an emphasis on **dungeon crawling** and **mob killing**.
  - The term **extraction** was debated. While not strictly accurate, the concept of going into Rifts, looting, and escaping does apply and we could make this fit closer to an extraction if desired.
  - Consideration for **roguelite** elements: players may retain long-term progression, but lose loot on death.
  - Early Reddit pitches framed the game as “roguelike,” but current direction favors progression-focused gameplay.
- Agreed not to lock into terminology too early. Suggested to define mechanics first, then decide on genre labels.

## Core Game Loop
- The primary loop is:
  - Collect resources → craft key → enter Rift → kill mobs → complete objective → exit Rift → regear → repeat.
- Two loops proposed:
  - **In-Rift loop:** combat, objectives, loot.
  - **Out-of-Rift loop:** gear management, preparation, upgrades.
- Goal is to keep Rift entry low-friction—outside gameplay should enhance but not gate Rift access.

---

## Game Pillars
- Pillars are foundational principles, not features:
  - **Player Choice**: agency in how goals are approached.
  - **Player Progression**: advancement through gear, abilities, access to tougher content.
  - **Discovery**: secrets, lore, NPCs, hidden rooms.
  - **Evolving Simplicity**: gradually introducing complexity.
- Noted that some items listed as pillars may actually be gameplay features.

---

## Motivation / Incentives
- Discussed **why players enter Rifts**:
  - Gear upgrades
  - Skill enhancement
  - Completionism (e.g. collections, quests, bosses)
  - Exploration
- Suggested long-term goals:
  - Museum collection
  - War libraries tied to guilds
  - Singular epic questlines
  - Divine Essences

---

## Combat & Player Progression
- Addressed whether players are incentivized to kill mobs or simply avoid them.
  - ARPG standard: mobs drop loot or XP.
  - Current system: clearing mob spawners unlocks rewards.
- Suggestion to explore locked rooms with enemy-clear requirements.
- Killing mobs may tie into gear crafting via unique mob drop components.
- Balancing XP around killing mobs as primary source of advancement.

---

## Gear Progression & Crafting
- Consensus:
  - Game should emphasize **loot finding**, with **crafting as a fallback** for unlucky players.
  - Crafted gear should:
    - Require rare materials (possibly mob drops).
    - Be expensive or resource-intensive.
    - Use limited socket pools for modularity.
    - Be distinct from looted gear in function or customization.
- Ideas proposed:
  - Mystic Forge-style systems (combine materials → gear).
  - Exchange Gambling (Trash gear → unique currency → roll targeted gear using currency).
  - Tiered gear:
    - **Base gear** → **crafted gear** → **looted gear**
    - Gear crafted from Rift resources could have randomized sockets/gems.

---

## Game Development Philosophy
- Avoid starting with disjointed mechanics; build from core game purpose.
- Mechanics must support pillars and gameplay loop, not exist in isolation.
- Importance of **scope discipline**: knowing what fits vs. what to cut.

---

## Discussions & Open Threads
- **Pre-meeting post** and threads encouraged for broader participation.
- Example question for next meeting: **"Why leave a Rift?"**
  - Considered distinct from “pre/during/post Rift” structure.
  - Bag space is currently the only hard reason to leave.

---

**Next Actions**
- Posts to continue topic development
- A 15~30 minute buffer will be added between this meeting and BIG meeting to accommodate attendees.
- Next meeting will focus on 4 questions:
  - What kind of game are we trying to be?
  - Who are we primarily designing for?
  - What will players do repeatedly?
  - What values and design principles should guide development?
