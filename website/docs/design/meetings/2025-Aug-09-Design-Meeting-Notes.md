## [Visual Working Board PDF](/other-files/meeting-notes/Visual-Working-Board-8-9-25.pdf)

## Meeting Format
- Meeting included:
  - Idea sharing (15 minutes)
  - Weekly focus topic (30 minutes)
  - Review of existing and in-progress ideas (15 Miuntes)

## Rune Gems & Vanilla Gear Integration

### Rune Tiering System
- Proposed gem system aligns rune gems with vanilla gear tiers:
  - Example: low level gems socket into copper+ gear
  - Higher level gems unlock socketing in iron+, diamond+, etc
- Gating is enforced by tier compatibility
- Preserves vanilla progression instead of overriding it with early modded gear
- Encourages “vanilla plus” progression while unlocking magical enhancements

### Design Intent
- Prevents immediate obsolescence of base Minecraft gear
- Encourages players to engage with Minecraft’s native systems early on
- Creates cohesion across systems by building on what already exists

## Rift Refreshments & Provisions

### Food & Drink Systems
- Builds on prior meeting discussion of hunger-based regen systems
- Refreshments and Provisions are two separate item classes:

#### Rift Refreshments
- Inspired by the tea shop concept
- Provide **short term potion-like buffs** (15–30 seconds)
- One active at a time, new drink overrides the previous

#### Provisions
- Provide **longer-term** for the full Rift session
- Tie into hunger/stamina systems
- Designed for consistency across an entire run

## Divine Essences

### Concept Overview
- Divine Essences serve as an endgame progression path and long-term goal
- Can be collected, split, or combined
- May be used to unlock powerful blocks

### Implementation Ideas
- Suggested total of **nine essences** to match Minecraft’s hotbar or a potential pantheon
- Rainbow essence (all combined) proposed as a high-tier objective
- Drops can act as **catalysts** or **crafting components**
- Potential to link essences to specific Rift types or challenges

---

## Player Progression Systems

### Stat Based Design
- Shift toward a **stat system** instead of skill trees alone:
  - Base stats increase with level (e.g. Strength, Intelligence, Constitution)
  - Stat growth gives players a sense of long-term power

### Guild & Talent Integration
- Talent trees could still exist and tie into guild progression
- Divine Essences could offer final-tier unlocks or passive bonuses

### Core Goals
- Ensure players feel stronger over time, even without high-end gear
- Progression should affect base player ability, not just loadout

---

## Additional Topics

### Vanilla+ Rift Tools
- One-time-use items (e.g., grenades) proposed as loot drops
- Increases variety in loot tables and combat engagement
- Concern: players may hoard consumables out of fear of wasting them
- Arrow types and similar consumables suggested as craftables
- Made outside the Rift but impactful within
- Fits the goal of enriching Minecraft-style combat without overwhelming with new systems

### Weapon Design
- Ideas include flamingos, umbrellas, and ether rifles.
- Template for submission includes:
  - Name, description, reach, handedness
  - Stat modifiers
  - Offhand benefits
  - Basic attack and unique ability

### Weapon Classes
- Should consider ARPG conventions (e.g., clubs, blades, spears)
- Suggest updating the template to reference weapon **types or roles**
- Encourage balance of **creative flavor** and mechanical design

### Endgame Planning
- Dedicated discussion on **what endgame should look like**.
- Topics to include:
  - Defining level caps or completion milestones.
  - Endgame content vs. sandbox freedom.
  - Whether collecting all 9 Divine Essences is the final objective.
  - Alternate ideas for endgame beyond the current essence system.

### Pillar Consolidation
- Goal: finalize core **game design pillars** in the upcoming meeting
- Contributors asked to consider:
  - Which pillars overlap?
  - Which can be merged?
  - Which values define the heart of the experience?

### Tool Durability
- Durability is removed entirely from tools, in and out of the Rift.
- Based on previous community vote.

### Rift Access
- Entry process likened to a Minecraft speedrun.
- Variability in player experience is high depending on RNG and seed.
- More testing needed to establish average access time.
