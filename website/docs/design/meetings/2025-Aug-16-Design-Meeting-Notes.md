## [Visual Working Board PDF](/other-files/meeting-notes/Visual-Working-Board-8-16-25.pdf)

## Meeting Format
- Meeting included:
  - Idea sharing (15 minutes)
  - Weekly focus topic (30 minutes)
  - Review of existing and in-progress ideas (15 Miuntes)

## Potion System Overhaul

### Core Purpose
- Vanilla and Vault Hunters potions feel **underused** and **uninspired**
- Desire to make potions cool, strategic, and **part of core gameplay** again

### Proposed Features
- **Multi-effect potions** with a **point buy balancing system**:
  - Stronger effects must be balanced with drawbacks
  - Inspired by *The Witcher* and *Potion Craft*
- **New potion mechanics**:
  - Potions that **coat weapons** with temporary effects
  - **Rift-exclusive ingredients** gathered during runs
  - Brewing influenced by ingredient prep (powdering, fermenting, cooking)
  - Alternative base liquids (e.g., Rift water types)
  - **Larger potion bottles** with multiple sips

### Crafting Enhancements
- **Return potion brewing to cauldrons**:
  - Could use a **multi-block structure** or recipe system
  - Suggestion: brewing stand must be adjacent to a cauldron to enable advanced functionality
  - Inspired by *Terraria*-style proximity-based crafting

## Rift Water Bottles & Liquid Variants
- Different Rift biomes could offer unique water sources
- These liquids affect potion base stats (e.g., "+1 base potency")
- Encourages exploration and biome variety to access new potion strategies

## Essence System Integration
- Suggestion to merge **Essence system** with potion crafting
- Convert materials into **essences** for use, storage, or recombination
- Concerns raised about clashing with other essence-heavy mods (*Mystical Agriculture*, *Botania*)
- Recommended focus: **custom implementation** over kitchen-sink integrations
- Add-ons can be used to tweak existing mods for consistency.

## Leveling & Player Progression

### Forum Highlights
- A **forum post on player stats** 150+ responses
- Much of the feedback ties into player progression, separation, and identity
- Spreadsheet/graph in development to visualize progression systems
- Guild progression mock-up in chat includes unlock details

### Progression Systems
- Separate **modded gear** (base gear) from vanilla gear
- Use the **XP bar or custom systems** for level tracking
- Suggested **gates** tied to bosses or Rift difficulty to regulate progression
- Inspired by *Vault Hunters*’ single gate mechanic leveling up

### Wanderer’s Charm
- Proposed upgrades to enhance utility and unlock more escape/return options as the player advances

### Rift Key Maker
- Discussion on upgrading the key maker for higher Rift tiers
- Alternative idea: **remove the key maker entirely** and bake its logic into the Rift portal itself

## Additional Topics

### Mod Architecture & Project Organization
- Once a pitch passes, **ownership becomes unclear**
- Concern: no clear team or leader picks up implementation afterward
- Coordination between teams (Art, Lore, Development) is currently lacking
Suggested:
- Break feature development into **assignable tasks**
- Use big meetings to surface **cross-team topics**
- Example: Hub World needs to be discussed at the **Aug 30th large meeting**

### Combat Crafting & Item Usage
- Reintroduce **vanilla+ combat tools**, like crafted arrows or throwable items
- Designed for **impactful but consumable** use during Rifts
- Desire to **retain vanilla gear viability** throughout the game
- XP-based progression proposed in place of enchantments
- Armor trims could be used to **add modular buffs**, referencing the *Prominence* mod
