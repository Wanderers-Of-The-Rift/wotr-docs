## Game Vision & Genre

### ARPG as Core Identity
- General consensus is that **Wanderers of the Rift is an Action RPG** built in modded Minecraft.
- Central themes:
  - Combat and skill-based builds.
  - Loot-focused exploration and player progression.
  - Players define their fantasy through build crafting and choices.

### Not Just a Label
- Avoid overcommitting to terms like “extraction shooter” or “roguelite.”
- Labels like these help communicate vibes, not strict mechanics
- Community and content creators may ultimately define the pack’s genre more than the devs

### Positioning Compared to Other Packs
- Emphasis on custom integration, not a kitchen sink modpack.
- Avoids leaning too heavily on automation, farming, or pure sandbox building
- Minecraft familiarity is a plus, but not the focus

## Target Players

### Primary Players
- Players who:
  - Enjoy build-crafting and ARPG-style combat
  - Are open to Minecraft’s modding systems
  - Prefer solo or co-op PvE over PvP
  - Are drawn to games like Path of Exile, Diablo, Last Epoch

### Audience & Tone
- Not a hardcore experience
- Targeting **casual ARPG fans**, with flexibility for both structured progression and creative expression
- Okay if it’s “not for everyone.” Expect it may not appeal to some players

### PvP Discussion
- PvP considered problematic due to build imbalance
- Potential for instanced combat (e.g., gladiator arenas), but not core gameplay
- Shared sentiment: PvE remains the priority

---

## Gameplay Loop

### Core Loop Summary
- **Out of Rift**: Craft, upgrade gear, prepare builds.
- **In Rift**: Kill mobs, complete objectives, loot rewards.
- The loop repeats with upgrades feeding into future Rifts.

### Poll Results
- Interactive poll during the meeting showed:
  - **Rifting** was the most enjoyable part of the loop.
  - Reinforces that Rift runs are the core player draw.

### Rift Entry
- Low friction emphasized.
- The goal is to make base Rift entry cheap, with power gains coming from in-Rift performance.
- Avoid forcing farming or gating basic access behind grind.

### Mod-Supported ARPG Loop
- Proposed structure:
  - **Enter Rifts easily**, with low barriers
  - **Farm** to get stronger within the Rifts. not just to access them
  - Mods should feel like a natural extension of the progression loop

## Additional Topics
Emerged organically through discussion

### 20–60 Minute Session Target
- Proposed range for a Rift run: **20 to 60 minutes**
- Not a hard cap, but used to guide objective design and loot pacing

#### Concerns
- 60 minutes might feel long unless it's a special quest or multi-part objective
- Player attention spans vary. shorter sessions may appeal to a broader audience
- Final duration will be adjusted based on playtesting

#### Soft Timers & Mechanics
- Suggestions included:
  - **Soft timers**: Difficulty or instability increases over time
  - **Loot-weight pressure**: Limited inventory capacity discourages long stays
  - Use of backpacks and skill trees to alter item weight and movement penalties

### Item Weight & Inventory Design

- **Item "weight"** discussed conceptually:
  - Refers to strategic value or interaction cost, not physical mechanics
- Minecraft’s default system gives every item high weight (e.g., small inventory)
- Progression can involve upgrades that **reduce friction** while maintaining tension

### Player Guidance & Onboarding

- Some guidance is necessary, especially for Minecraft-first players
- Example tutorial flow:
  - "Here’s the ability bench. Here’s how you upgrade your gear. Now go do a Rift."
- Not aimed at expert pack players or heavy tech automation fans

### Build Diversity & Synergy

- Build crafting should support multiple viable paths
- **Synergy** between abilities, gear, and stats is a defining mechanic
- Suggested skill interactions:
  - Minion builds
  - Stat-based bonuses
  - Movement/speed-based advantages

**Next Actions**
- Pillars discussion was postponed to a future session
- Create a pre-meeting post to gather and define proposed pillars
