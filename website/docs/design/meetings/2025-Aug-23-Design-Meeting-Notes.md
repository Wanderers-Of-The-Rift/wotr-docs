## [Visual Working Board PDF](/other-files/meeting-notes/Visual-Working-Board-8-23-25.pdf)

## Meeting Format
- Meeting included:
  - Idea sharing (15 minutes)
  - Weekly focus topic (30 minutes)
  - Review of existing and in-progress ideas (15 Miuntes)

---

## Classes
- Initial confusion noted around stance on class systems: original messaging emphasized "no classes," only build freedom
- New suggestion: **unlockable archetypes** as mid-game specializations
- Proposed as **bundles of passive traits** linked to abilities and lore, avoiding locked-in roles
- Could be implemented through **rune gems requiring certain attributes or ability slots**

### Non-Combat Archetypes
- Suggested addition of profession-like bonuses (e.g. double mob drops, bonus wood gathering)
- Emphasis on passive, non-combat utility to enhance immersion and roleplay
- These bonuses would affect overland activities, **not Rift gameplay**

---

## Skill Tree

### Star Map Layout
- Star map structure proposed:
  - Center = core passives
  - Radiating “wedges” tied to **Essence types**
  - Outer rim = **Divine Essence** tier skills
  - Color progression: center (dark) → outer (rainbow).
  - Web of interlinked passive skills.

### Visual & Functional Design
- Tree connected by curved lines with passive bonuses at intersections
- Skill point cost increases by distance from center:
  - Core: 10 points
  - Mid-tier: 20–30 points
  - Divine Rim: 40–50 points
- Skills purchased using **essence**, with costs reduced by **Rift completions**
- Divine edge unlocks rare, powerful effects tied to divine materials

### Passive Skill Examples
- Double jump
- Limited glide
- Increased wood when chopping down trees

## Essence Economy
- Proposed using **essence** to reduce cost of skills
- Essence could be farmed outside Rifts (e.g. from overland tasks), encouraging broader gameplay loops
- Showing gathered essence resources per player

## Progression
- [Link](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1408533253790367784/1408533253790367784)

### Dual Progression Tracks
- Two primary systems:
  - **Leveling and Attributes** (Strength, Speed, Utility, etc.)
  - **Guild Reputation** (guild specific progress and unlocks)

### Attribute Condensation
- Proposal to condense six core stats into three meta-stats:
  - Strength/Speed (Force)
  - Abilities/Magic (Aptitude)
  - Utility/Survivability (Presence)
- Level 100 model with dynamic XP scaling and diminishing returns

### Perk System
- Perks tied to attribute milestones.
- Choose between Perk A or B per tier, can unlock both eventually via looped investment
- Examples:
  - Step assist
  - Reduced burn time
  - Fall damage resistance

## Guild Reputation Unlock Model
- UI design in progress to visualize guild progression
- Proposed **three types of unlocks**:
  - Linear level-based
  - Reputation-only
  - Combined requirements

---

## Additional Topics

## Leveling vs. Gameplay Progression
- Discussion around pros/cons of traditional level-based systems
- Alternative suggested: tie progression to **completing gameplay objectives** rather than XP numbers
- Question raised if **essence + objective hybrid** would offer better experience

### Combined Progression Proposal
- Blend of divine-essence unlock path with traditional leveling:
  - Example: 60% unlocked via milestones, 40% via essence grinding
  - Would create **dual paths to progression** while preserving endgame goals
- Essence could be used to **amplify perks**, unlock unique skills, or offer alternate progression.
- Encourages overland farming and provides non-Rift activities for progression
