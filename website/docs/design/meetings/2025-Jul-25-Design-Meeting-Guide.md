# 🧾 Game Design Identity: What WotR *Is* (Phase 1)

Companion guide to help follow along during meeting  
Starting point for defining what *kind* of game Wanderers of the Rift is and what core values guide its design.

---

## Goal

We are **not** designing individual mechanics, abilities, or systems yet.

We are here to explore:

> **What kind of experience is WotR meant to be, who is it for?**

contributor submissions and groups them to reflect, blend, and align on shared design

---

## 1. Game Vision
*“What kind of game are we trying to be?”*

Format:  
**WotR is a [type of experience] where players [core fantasy]. Unlike other packs, it focuses on [distinctive trait].**

### Submissions

- A) Action-focused Minecraft experience. Sharp, rewarding combat. Depth unlocks over time.

- B) Extraction shooter feel; high risk, high reward. Base + player progression after each run.

- C)Creative sandbox extraction with ARPG elements. Player freedom front and center.

- D)A modded Minecraft Action RPG built on Rift-based dungeons, loot progression, and guild-based questing.

- E) Minecraft-first, with roguelite ARPG elements. Designed so Minecraft players can pick it up easily.

#### Common

- The **Rift** is central. Procedurally generated. Combat, loot, and risk
- Progression is **meaningful and escalating**. Players unlock new systems and shape future runs
- Focus on **player-driven strategy and builds**, not just fast-twitch combat
- This isn’t a generic modpack. **Purpose-built** with a loop and identity

---

## 2. Primary Player Focus
*“Who are we designing around?”*

Format:  
**Our target player enjoys [playstyle], with support for [secondary style].**

### Submissions

- A) ARPG-style build crafting and combat-focused players. Creative play supported, but not core

- B) Combat/build synergy players. Solo or co-op. Automation optional

- C) Minecraft modded players open to ARPG. Minecraft is the entry point, not ARPG

- D) Fans of PoE/Diablo/Last Epoch who want that power loop inside Minecraft

#### Common

- Combat and builds are the **core experience**
- Automation, tech, and sandbox are **supportive tools**, not the focus
- **Solo and co-op** both matter, neither is sidelined

---

## 3. Core Gameplay Loop
*“What do players do again and again and why?”*

Format:  
**Players prepare by [activity], enter a Rift to [goal], then return to [progression/reward loop]**

### Submissions

- A) Build synergistic loadouts, tailor Rift keys, extract loot to unlock progression

- B) Choose quests/modifiers → fight in Rift → return for rewards + future prep

- C) Use flexible tools & potions → creatively fight mobs → iterate builds

- D) Loop length varies. Rifts last 20–60 min. Flexible progression methods (farming, crafting, etc.)

### Common

> **Prepare → Enter Rift → Fight → Extract → Upgrade → Repeat**
- Agency in prep
- High-stakes Rift runs
- Return for unlocks
- Escalation and variety

---

## 4. Design Pillars
*“What values guide our design?”*

Format: Short thematic statements like “Respect the Player” or “Progression Unlocks Power”

### Submissions

- A) Evolving Simplicity  
- B) Players Shape Their Path  
- C) Respect the Player
- D) Risk = Reward  
- E) Power Growth Feels Earned  
- F) Flexible Builds
- G) Let the Player Play
- H) Challenge Without Forced Meta
- I) Play How You Want  
- J) Short or Long Sessions  
- K) Solo or Co-op First-Class

---

## Common
Themes that showed up across multiple submissions:

- **Agency**  
  Let players shape builds, choose paths, define goals

- **Respect**  
  Avoid grind-for-grind’s sake, reduce friction, don’t punish curiosity

- **Replayability**  
  Meaningful, escalating progression and build variation

- **Accessibility**  
  Supports both short bursts and long sessions, solo or group

- **Challenge**  
  Risk has weight, survival matters, power feels earned
