# Project Direction
- Patrigan's departure created loss of direction
- Project slowed during summer due to availability
- Creative energy remains high but implementation resources are limited
- Expanding without a polished core leads to confusion and spent effort

## Actions
- Pause new features and expansive lore
- Suspend pitch-to-feature processing
- Hold until dev team expands and activity rises
- Refocus on what is already in the mod
Stopping:
- New feature pitches through pitch-to-feature pipeline
- Expansive lore development
Continuing:
- Adding to backlog
- Open Ideas Forum (Now Ideas-Backlog)
- Current Development on existing systems
- Datapack Development for immediate impact
- Focused playtesting for current apabilities

## Focus Areas
- Keep lore concise, as players only read short snippets in-game
- Use the quest book mod to drip-feed recipes and content, leaving open-ended interpretation
- Polish existing systems and use data packs for tweaks
- Sp3cialK coordinating with Divides By Zero on data pack documentation and templates

---

## Data Packs
- Capabilities include:
    - Rift loot by tiers
    - Essence values
    - Crafting recipes
    - Quest lines
    - Gear implicit and rune gem modifiers
    - Ability creation and upgrade paths
    - Objective scaling and pacing adjustments

---

## Art and Build
- Apply chosen color palette
- Update UI and create gear/mob assets
- Expand variety with more rooms, themes, and POIs.
- Use tiered pool of rooms:
    - Tiers 1–5: base pool
    - Tier 6+: additional rooms

### Blocks
- Discussion about adding block sets.
- Current: marble, velvet, bronze.
  - Marble usable.
  - Velvet not finished.

---

## Mod Development and Data Pack Work
- Divides By Zero working on guild system
- Req developing gear system, ability enhancements, anomalies/shrines, and bug fixes
- Data pack work will be accessible once templates and documentation are ready
- Goal: host a workshop where contributors design and test their own abilities

---

## Ability System
- Infinite ability potential discussed
- Example: Fireball using saturation instead of mana
- Additional ideas: toggleable super sprint draining saturation, big jump ability

---

## Support and Future Plans
- Create new forum sections for data pack development
- Provide templates and documentation
- Open discussion threads for loot modifiers and feedback
- Emphasis on quests and lore

### Game Design and Summary
- Balancing and tuning may move under game design
- Data pack work remains under modpack development
- Goal: polished beta release on CurseForge and Modrinth
- “Not shutting down ideas, just channeling creativity where it makes the most impact.”

---

## Rift Spawners
- Proposal: complete Rifts by clearing a percentage of spawners
- Would require standardizing spawner counts per room
- WarrenGore created a spreadsheet of spawner data (may be outdated)
- Suggested to test with current info and adjust based on play

---

## MotR Discussion
- jyu interested in releasing first version of materials MotR
- Request for list of missing items.
- Status:
    - Slabs, walls, stairs mostly complete.
    - Copper slabs done.
    - Missing: no grav blocks, no-substrate, persistent, etc.
    - Glass stairs not yet done due to technical issues

### Task List on Repo
- Suggestion to create task list in GitHub issues
- Include missing textures
- Vanilla textures used for slabs and stairs
- Some blocks may have broken textures (in hand vs placed)
- Suggestion to link Google Doc to repo
- Previous link not read-only; Google changed permissions
- Readme update planned to include corrected link
- No-gravity concrete not yet moved
- Concrete completed in main mod but needs migration
- Recipes are handled
