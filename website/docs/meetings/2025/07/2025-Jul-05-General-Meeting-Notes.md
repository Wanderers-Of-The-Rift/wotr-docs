    * any extra building materials we add that don’t serve a core gameplay function, such slabs, stairs, non-gravity effected, etc. versions of vanilla blocks
    * Want to get dynamic datapack built in to allow info to be uploaded and produce the blocks (attackeight)
* WotR \- Wanderers of the Rift
    * Will be published in official modpack
    * Main gameplay mod
* BotR \- Builders of the Rift
    * Will **NOT** be published in official modpack
    * Do not use any blocks from BotR in the builds as they will not work\!
    * Used for things that will only exist on the build server to assist builders, like the builder’s glasses

## Section Updates

* Tags were added in [assets-and-requests](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1377672765926150174) for anything needed for MotR or BotR

## Q\&A

* Melancholic Adventurer - What are the full names of the 2 extra mods
    * Attackeight - Materials of the Rift (MotR) and Builders of the Rift (BotR)

## After Party Comments, Post Meeting

* Thoughts on pitch to feature
    * WarrenGore will look to get a rough draft of a flow chart together for review. Should hopefully help with confusion on moving between steps, visual representation of [definition-of-ready](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1377663029595869254)
    * Pitches are yes/rework/no votes
    * Multiple competing/overlapping pitches for a feature idea is okay. If more than one passes the pitch poll then they will be implemented for feature review
    * Do not need to include lore/art/build/dev/etc. aspects in the pitch as it should be gameplay focused, but can be good to call out high level that certain teams may be needed to implement
* Other conversations going on you should check out! ([pitch prep](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1377662922875998348))
    * [Shrines](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1388628696822190090) - posted last week
        * Interactable entities that give a temporary boost in the rift
    * [Hub World](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1390212047744143420) - posted a few days ago
        * A stable rift/dimension where NPCs, including guild members, reside
