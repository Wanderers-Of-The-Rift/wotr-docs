## What are we making?

* Wanderers of the Rift (WotR) is a new Minecraft modpack in the aRPG-pack genre. This is a community driven and developed project likely to end up in 1.22 Neoforge Minecraft
* Inspired by modern day aRPG endgame mechanics
    * Path of Exile 1/2
    * Last Epoch
    * Diablo
    * Minecraft Dungeons
    * … (not an exhaustive list)
* To get a good feel of the vibe WotR wants to create, check out PoE end game, and MC Dungeons

## What is a modern aRPG

* Real-time combat
* Strong looting and itemization
* Character Progression
* Isometric/Top Down
    * not sure if we want
* Endgame Loop
    * Tiered Dungeons/Maps
    * Extended Variety
    * Bosses
    * Targeted Farming
    * Seasonal Content
    * Roguelite Elements
        * Not making a roguelike/roguelite, just borrowing some elements
* Get inspired by the previously mentioned modern aRPGs\!

## Participation

* Active participation checked every 2-3 weeks
* Counts for ALL roles
    * Navigators and Project Leaders will be actively replaced
* Roles removed, no member will be kicked from the Discord
* Reapplication is easy, same as the current process ([open a ticket here](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1377644503900487792))
* Breaks are possible (and encouraged\!)
    * Reach out to project manager or coordinator to let them know of an impending break
* See Rules and Values for details
* Main thing is keeping people engaged and keep moving the project forward, while keeping an accurate counts of people in each team
* It’s a long process (two months overall) to reach the role removal stage, [see outline here](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1377643150826278973/1384912554639364110)
    * Reiterating people will not be kicked, just need to go through onboarding ticketing process to get team roles again

## Release Updates 0.1.4

* Things work again\!
* More theme variety
    * Mesa
    * Bees
    * Desert
    * Swamp
* NoGrav Blocks
    * Sand, gravel, concrete powder that do not fall
* Rifts work again…
    * (Noted as a good thing)
* Release 0.1.5 will likely be larger than release 0.1.4
    * RiftFaster, maybe?!

## Development Approach

* Generic Code
    * Easy Shifts Later \- code is flexible
    * Development and Lore (and Game Design) parallel
    * Can save time with this approach
* Framework Mod
    * Others could use things we create for their own mods/modpacks
* Maximum Datapackable
    * Make it so others can make changes without altering the mod itself
* High Configurability
    * Voting (in Discord) is often for defaults
    * Code will support more
    * Allows new ideas to be implemented that may be different from the default settings
* Low performance impacts
    * Rift generation was reworked to make everything as low impact as possible
* Accessibility
    * Always considered
    * See settings already implemented, like arachnophobia, and others on the accessibility menu we plan to add in the future
* Nothing is sacred, anything can change
    * Please see [Definition of Ready (Pitches to Rework)](https://discord.com/channels/1374772629298483202/1377663029595869254/1385358144279937084)
