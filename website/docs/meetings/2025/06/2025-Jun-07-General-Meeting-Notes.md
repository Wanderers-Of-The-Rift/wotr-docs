* Anorak \- where is Pat
    * RiftedArt \- taking a break
* WarrenGore \- Do you need me to create the project-forum posts for some of those topics that were mentioned? Responsibilities, server move, etc.
    * Barry Allen \- Can get roles/responsibilities created, hold on server move post
* WarrenGore \- How far out from an Alpha are we? I would expect MVP to be a ways out from Alpha release. (it was mentioned as a pivotal point to another answer)
    * Barry Allen \- still a ways out
