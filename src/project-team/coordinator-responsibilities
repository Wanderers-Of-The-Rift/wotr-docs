**Coordinator Role Responsibilities**  

**Bridge Communication Between Sections**  
- Act as a link between your section and the rest of the project.  
- Ensure requests from other sections are addressed and make requests when needed (e.g., art needing lore context).  

**Structuring and Standardization**  
- Organize and structure output from your section (e.g., documentation outlines, product standards).  
- Maintain consistency across project assets (e.g., standard image sizes, formats).  

**Discussion Management and Summarization**  
- Summarize key points of discussions (not every message, but outcomes and expectations).  
- Keep track of what needs to be done in your section and take action when necessary.  

**Decision Making and Polls**  
- Create and manage polls for important decisions.  
- Only coordinators should create polls to maintain order and clarity.  

**Support and Team Assistance**  
- Answer questions and help new team members get oriented.  
- Provide a role where people can ask questions about your section.  
- Delegate work among contributors as needed.  

**Moderation and Thread Management**  
- Mediate discussions and keep conversations on-topic.  
- Direct off-topic discussions to the appropriate channels or create new discussion spaces.  
- Control what is open for public conversation and what should be moderated.  
- Limit unnecessary thread creation to avoid duplicate discussions.  

**Coordination with Project Managers**  
- Participate in meetings with Project Managers to align decisions and structure discussions.
